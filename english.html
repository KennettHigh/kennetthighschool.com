                    "This class never ended. First of all, she was so dry. I happened to like the material we were reading, but she would go on and on about things for way too long. She would ask a question and when nobody responded, would just sit in an awkward silence for a while. Also, while not necessary, I personally wouldâ€™ve liked it if she were a bit more personable instead of stiff, all-business all the time. She was also a little too stringent with points. For example, I once turned in an essay four minutes after the due minute and she took off 5% for lateness. I might have been okay with that if not for the fact that she herself took months to grade anything and never finished grading by the due date at the end of the marking period. One thing that I both liked and disliked at times is that she grades everything in meticulous detail instead of by completion. It was nice to get feedback but that meant it was really easy to  lose points for small things." <br> <br>
