                    "Yâ€™all everything she said is absolutely true, super nice, really helpful, she has zero tolerance for any gossip or talking negatively about other students which I understand, she is relatable because shes young and open-minded, very much an upgrade from Decosta and literally we have had one quiz all year, absolute french god who can ACTUALLY speak the language ðŸ‘€" <br> <br>

                    "Sheâ€™s awesome! As said before, she doesnâ€™t tolerate any negative conversations in her class which is fine imo. She makes the class very engaging and fun w reading French books and doing cultural exploration stuff. Had one test the whole year and a couple of writing assignments. Overall, sheâ€™s chill and easygoing if you actually put in effort in class." <br> <br>

                    "takes offense to literally everything" <br> <br>
                    
                    Alleged Self Comment: <br>
                    "Self-rate lol. Anyway, I'm pretty chill with my classes and cut lots of slack to learners who try. As long as you are learning with me and communicating about it, we will be on good terms. We chat in French, and I'm careful to act things out or show visuals and speak clearly so everyone can follow along. Fun facts: most exams are projects (easier to show off your skills instead of multiple choice), we read actual books in French for fun, and we play games in class even in the advanced levels. I love teaching and building classroom material for activities. It stinks not having a dedicated classroom or materials to provide the best experience for my classes. <br>
                    Ppl tryna hand in GoogleTranslate randomness or coming to class with their own negativity are the only ones who do poorly, aka you gotta want to fail to make it happen, aka nobody gets left behind in my class by my choice. The only down sides to taking French with me is that I sometimes struggle to select appropriate due dates for upcoming projects and I'm not the best at grading things quickly because paperwork can be hard for me. Other than that, my shortcomings stem from not having a designated classroom for materials, games, fun activities, and our French library. I have to keep lessons simple so I can teach them from anywhere any year. Hopefully in the future, the high school values me/French enough one day to make room for us." <br> <br>

                    "Once during online school my parents who speaks fluent french walked in and almost cried because DeCosta lacks any kind of french accent. Whenever she teaches pronunciation I try to do the exact opposite of what she says and usually I end up being correct."
