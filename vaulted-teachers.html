                    "very stand off ish, strictly professional, i think she needs to ask her students questions about their hobbies and how they are coming along, needs to build a good relationship with her students" <br> <br>
                    
                    "grades her whole regular class like her honors class. We had a 5 paragraph essay and gave half of the class a very poor grade on it and didnâ€™t make any comments as to why. She needs to stop grading us so harshly, I really struggle in this class. Not only is she bad at grading but is also very stand offish and wonâ€™t have a heart to heart conversation with her students and does not put in the effort to have her students succeed. If it wasnâ€™t so far into the school year I wouldâ€™ve dropped out of her class if i knew this is what the work would be like. I was in honors la last year and dropped out to go into advanced and the work is a lot harder then my work last year and itâ€™s supposed to be an easier class. Not only that but she gave her regular class a 60 word vocab test that she said weeks before that we were not going to have a test on this. She did not give her honors class a 60-word vocab test" <br> <br>
