                    "She is the most passive aggressive and condescending teacher I have. On one occasion I was planning making up a test during flex. She specifically told me to come 1st flex cause we had a fire drill 5th. Come first flex I walk in and in the most passive aggressive and condescending way possible she said "I thought we agreed on fifth flex." I was just standing there insanely mad but I explained what she said. She then continued to pat herself on the back by saying "good thing I told you to come first flex" and didn't even apologize for the confusion. Imagine this one occasion but make it every single class with her." <br> <br>

                    "Talk about a stupid a** b****. Hot C*** material right here. Can absolutely get f*****" <br> <br>
                    
                    "kind of nice and all just she could take more time teaching the content instead of just flying through it. also made another student cry 😀" <br> <br>
                    
                    "She’s literally the worst. She doesn’t know how to teach and leaves most of class. She spends more time on her phone calling her son or talking to people in the hallway. When she does teach she just rushes through it and expects us to already know the information. I end up having to stay up all night teaching myself the content. You would think if most of the students in your class are failing the tests you would change the way you are teaching or push the test back or something, but not Dr.Tamargo. Since she’s been doing this for so long she thinks her ways are best. Absolutely no one came out of the classroom for the thousand years she’s been teaching and enjoyed it or wanted to become a teacher after having her class. She also gets angry when you aren’t understanding the content and are asking too many questions about something. Now students already in the 7th week of school are nervous to ask her questions without her getting mad at us. In conclusion, this b**** needs to go. PeriodT!!!" <br> <br>
                    
                    "I have never had such a sh**y math teacher! I hate math it’s simply not something I’m good at, but I have never hated the math classes I have been in. I have had great teachers who have been kind enough to be patient with the speed I learn best with, but not Mrs.Tamargo I don’t think she intentionally makes me feel stupid but she does it anyway. I wake up and try to get ready as slow as possible so I can be late to her class that’s how much I hate it. I’m not a bad student I go home and study all the material to maintain an A in that class. I am in algebra 1 obviously I learn a little slower in math but she goes way too fast, like teaches 1 lessons in a day fast. She isn’t mindful of any of the students in her class it’s not just me it’s my whole class that dislikes her! If you ask a question she belittles you, and uses the same phrase “we just learned this”. No you went over it in 20 minutes we didn’t learn shit, I feel so dumb wherever I ask her a question. It’s not only the fact that she is a terrible teacher she is just straight up rude and snarky with her students." <br> <br>
                    
                    "This extraterrestrial commonly referred to as "Dr. Tamargo" flies through notes faster than a f**king comet. I think she has misunderstood the speed at which a human can note take, as a human is unable to take notes as fast as a descending comet." <br> <br>
                    
                    "she wants me to take a test i didnt learn anything on because i was sick for a week. then proceeded to give me a zero on the assignments i was sick for. " <br> <br>
                    
                    "She a terrible teacher, but she kinda bad tho...." <br> <br>
                    
                    "She’s always rushing through sh*t most of the time she’s out wondering in the halls.Talking to any teacher she literally sees she gets mad when we come in like 1 minute after the bell rang and gets annoyed so fkn fast like bro? She gives us like hella work to do and expects us to know it all is in one day.. LIKE SHE DOESNT EXPLAIN IT GOOD. So b*tchy too like she gives so much attitude?!? like for what" <br> <br>

                    "Ahem. As Bruno Mars would say, THIS B****!!!! she’s horrible, the only positive thing abt her class was that you could make fun of her in person right before your eyes. And also she would turn around and write on the board and you would [REDACTED]. So embarrassing for her lmfaoooooo. Hate this [REDACTED]." <br> <br>

                    "I think all of the other comments aptly describe her" <br> <br>
