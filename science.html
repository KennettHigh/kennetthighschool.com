                    "Worst teacher I‚Äôve ever had. The reason why I will never take another physics class again, although I was excited for the class at the beginning of the year. Does very little actual teaching, only going through premade slideshows and writing down homework answers (never really explains them). If you‚Äôre in AP get a tutor ASAP unless you‚Äôre an actual genius. Tests are SO hard and homework takes hours.  Folmar is so not personable that it was painful and came off as incredibly [REDACTED] to me. Only ever asked guys for math answers, only asked me to read and often complimented my handwriting. Seemed surprised that I was in BC Calc and the colleges that I was getting into. Also made some pretty questionable comments about race and sent an email including a winky face to one of my girlfriends.  Would give 0/10 if I could." <br> <br>

                    "One of my favourite teachers at the high school. He has the attention span and humour of a five year old (/pos) but he makes class really enjoyable. He likes to bully people but it‚Äôs okay because we bully him back. Only bad thing is that he doesn‚Äôt cover most of the material in class so you have to learn it yourself (at least for ap)" <br> <br>

                    "Pretty great as a person but will not teach most of the things you need to know. Read the textbook and you‚Äôll be fine but I wish that he actually taught more. Also has a childish sense of humor and loves to make jokes which makes the class more enjoyable." <br> <br>
