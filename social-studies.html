She may come off as annoying because she does assign a lot of work, but she does a great job preparing you for the tests if you do the work. She helped my writing so much and I am so glad I took her class before apush because it gave me such a better understanding of the essays than brientnall taught us. She is also a super nice person and is very understanding if you just are open and communicate with her. She truly wants the best for her students and if you are looking for an AP elective I would definitely take one of hers." <br> <br>
